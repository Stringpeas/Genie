            If I could wish upon a shooting star<br>
            and I had the power to be anything,<br>
            anything at all<br>
            contrary to popular belief I would not choose<br>
            to be an engineer.<br>
            <br>
            I would not choose to be<br>
            a father<br>
            a teacher<br>
            a leader<br>
            a life breather<br>
            a peaceful sunday morning<br>
            <br>
            no,<br>
            <br>
            If I could wish upon a shooting star<br>
            and I had the power to be anything in the world,<br>
            on the seemingly surprising contrary, I would not choose<br>
            to be your lover.<br>
            <br>
            I would not choose to be the lips you find with yours<br>
            or the fingertips that touch after a lewd glance at the shore<br>
            <br> 
            no,<br>
            <br>
            If I had the power to be anything,<br>
            anything at all<br>
            I would choose to be your friend.<br>
            <br>
            The voice on the other end of the phone,<br>
            The arms that seem to always bring you comfort<br>
            and the silence that just makes you feel safe.<br>
            <br>
            But if I had all the power in the world,<br>
            this would be much easier as I would<br>
            have the strength to look at you and not feel my heart throb<br>
            as it begs to escape it's caged bars.<br>
            <br>
            But there is no shooting star<br>
            and you make me stumble<br>
            so for now I'll curse my lack of strength and we'll stay strangers.<br>
        </p>
