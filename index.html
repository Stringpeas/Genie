        <p>
            If a genie landed on my lap right now<br>
            and I had the power to be anything,<br>
            anything at all<br>
            contrary to popular belief I would not choose<br>
            to be a scientist.<br>
            <br>
            I would not choose to be<br>
            a father<br>
            a teacher<br>
            a leader<br>
            a life breather<br>
            a peaceful sunday morning.<br>
            <br>
            no,<br>
            <br>
            If a genie landed on my lap right now<br>
            and I had the power to be anything in the world<br>
            contrary to popular belief I would not choose<br>
            to be your lover.<br>
            <br>
            I would not choose to be the lips you find with yours<br>
            of the set of hips that you press into the frame of your bedroom door<br>
            <br>
            no,<br>
            <br>
            If I had the power to be anything,<br>
            anything at all<br>
            I would choose to be your friend.<br>
            <br>
            The voice on the other end of the phone<br>
            The arms you find refugee<br>
            and the one place that makes you feel safe<br>
            <br>
            But If i had all the power in the world<br>
            this would be so much easier for I dont<br>
            have the strength to look at you and not feel my heart throbbing<br>
            begging to escape its cage<br>
            <br>
            but there is no genie<br>
            and you make me stumble<br>
            so for now I'll curse my lack of strength and we'll stay strangers.<br>
        </p>
